The main objective of air pollution data is to predict annual average air pollution concentrations of various cities in the U.S. using predictors such as data about population density, urbanization, road density, as well as satellite pollution data and chemical modeling data. In the dataset, there are 48 attributes/features with values for each of the 876 monitors (observations). 

The value column indicates the PM2.5 concentration level average of fine particles/volume of air for 876 gravimetric monitors for 2008.
